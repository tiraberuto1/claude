# Asset Generator

Generate PNG images (Gemini or xAI Grok) and GLB 3D models (Tripo) from text prompts. These are paid APIs — every call costs real money. The free exception is `qwen-image`, a local GPU generator some machines have. Image tools live at `.claude/skills/asset-gen/tools/`; 3D goes through the `tripo` CLI. Run from the project root and keep runtime-loaded outputs under `assets/`.

## Models

| Model | Flag | Cost | Notes |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| Gemini 3.1 Flash Image | `--model gemini` | 5¢ (512) · 7¢ (1K) · 10¢ (2K) · 15¢ (4K) | ~10 s per image |
| Grok Imagine Image 2.0 | `--model grok` | 6¢ (1K) · 8¢ (2K), +1¢ per reference image | 1–2 min per image |
| Qwen-Image | `qwen-image` CLI (local, if installed) | free, minutes per image | Simple images — textures, props, icons, UI, backgrounds, in-image text; native transparency |

Gemini and Grok are equally strong: both follow detailed prompts closely, and both slip on small details — a miscounted item, a mirrored left/right. Use whichever key is set; with both, `asset_gen.py` defaults to Gemini for speed. When an asset is quality-critical (a character reference that anchors 3D or animation, a hero image) and both keys are set, generate it with both and keep the better one.

## Images

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/asset-gen/tools/asset_gen.py image \
  --prompt "the full prompt" -o assets/img/car.png
```

`--model` (default `gemini` when its key is set, else `grok`) · `--size` (default `1K`; Gemini also `512`/`4K`) · `--aspect-ratio` (default `1:1`; also `16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, `3:4`, `3:2`, `2:3`).

**Image-to-image:** pass `--image ref.png` and the model sees the reference — prompt only for what changes (angle, pose, recolor), don't re-describe appearance. Use this for style families (one hero asset → the rest), variants, and multi-view sets.

**Small sprites:** minimum generation is 1K, so a 1024px image downscaled to 64px looks muddy. Design display sizes ≥128px, or generate a kit (multiple objects in one 1K image) and slice it with `tools/grid_slice.py ... --grid 2x2 --names "a,b,c,d"`, or prompt for bold flat forms that survive downscaling.

Review every PNG before any GLB conversion — a bad image wastes 30+ credits downstream.

### Background removal

Read `.claude/skills/asset-gen/rembg.md`. Key rule: **never prompt for a "transparent background"** (the generator bakes a checkerboard) — prompt a solid color, then matte it out. The one exception is `qwen-image rgba`, which outputs real alpha.

### Local generation (`qwen-image`)

If `command -v qwen-image` finds it, this machine runs Qwen-Image-2.1 on its own GPU. It costs nothing, so simple images go there first; keep the paid models for characters, references, and exact layouts.

```bash
qwen-image generate "the full prompt" -o assets/img/crate.png                 # --size WxH or --resolution N (default 1024)
qwen-image rgba "a wooden shield, game icon" -o assets/img/shield.png         # transparent PNG, no matting
qwen-image edit -i crate.png "mossy and cracked" -o assets/img/crate_old.png  # image-to-image; repeat -i for more refs
```

- One call at a time: each loads the whole model onto the GPU, so parallel calls run out of memory. Batch as one sequential loop.
- Minutes per 1024² image at the default 40 steps (~2.5 min on a 12 GB card) — longer than common shell-tool timeouts, so set a long timeout or run it in the background. Time the first call (`seconds` in `--json`) and plan batches from it; `--resolution 512 --steps 10` is ~8× faster for checking how a prompt reads.
- Judge `rgba` alpha from a composite on a contrasting color (`magick out.png -background magenta -flatten out_qa.png`), not the raw PNG.
- Out of memory → lower `--resolution` (edits use the most). On failure, `qwen-image info` reports GPU and model status.

## Animated sprites

Recipe: **reference → pose → video → extract frames → loop-trim → rembg.**

1. Reference (1K, neutral pose, solid BG) — anchors everything; review carefully.
2. Pose per action: image-to-image from the reference, prompt only the action.
3. Video from the pose frame: `asset_gen.py video --image pose.png --duration 2 -o walk.mp4` (Grok, needs `XAI_API_KEY`; `--duration` 1–15s; `--resolution` 720p at 14¢/s, or 480p at 8¢/s — enough for small sprites).
4. Extract: `ffmpeg -i walk.mp4 -vsync 0 frames/%04d.png`.
5. Loop-trim looping cycles (walk/idle): `tools/find_loop_frame.py frames/` returns the loop frame; delete frames past it. Skip for one-shots (attack/death).
6. Batch matte: `tools/rembg_matting.py --batch frames/ -o clean/`.

Reuse one reference for all of a character's actions. **Chaining** (feed action A's last frame as action B's start) keeps positional continuity — keep chains ≤2 deep, they drift.

## 3D models

The `tripo` CLI (`npm install -g tripo-cli`, key in `TRIPO_API_KEY`) owns the whole 3D path: submit, poll, download, credit pre-check, refunds on failure. Its own agent docs are the reference — `tripo docs --llm`, then `tripo docs --topic commands/process` / `examples/animation` / `common-errors` — this section only covers what is specific to game use here.

```bash
tripo make ref.png --name car -p face_limit=30000 -p auto_size=true --json --yes -o assets/glb
tripo make ref.png --name hero --then rig-check,rig:model=v1.0-20240301 --json --yes -o assets/glb
tripo anim retarget @hero --animation preset:biped:walk preset:biped:idle --json --yes -o assets/glb
```

- `make` is blocking (default timeout 30 min) and prints one JSON line: read `model_file`, `preview.png` and `credits_consumed` from it. Never add your own shorter timeout, never resubmit because a task_id appeared in stderr. If the process does die, `tripo task watch <id> --download` finishes the same task for free.
- Output lands in `<-o dir>/<name>-<id8>/` (`model.glb`, `preview.png`, `task.json`). Move or reference the GLB from there; `task.json` keeps the seeds and task id, so there is nothing else to save.
- `--name X` makes the task addressable as `@X` for later steps (retarget, convert, decimate). Retarget reuses the rig task — never re-rig for another clip; up to 5 animations per call, billed per animation.
- Model defaults to v3.1. For `face_limit` ≤ 20000 the CLI silently switches to P1 (low-poly topology, no `geometry_quality`) — that is the right choice for mobile-style budgets, but know it happens. `--for game-pc` converts to FBX by default; skip it for GLB engines.
- `-p geometry_quality=detailed -p texture_quality=detailed` is the HD tier (≈ double credits).
- Rig: keep `rig:model=v1.0-20240301` for bipeds — that is the rig motion.md's pipeline is certified against, and it uses the `preset:biped:*` clips below. The CLI's default rig (v2.5) covers quadrupeds, avians, etc. with `preset:<name>` clips (`idle walk run dive climb jump slash shoot hurt fall turn`); unverified with motion.md. `rig-check` in the chain aborts before rigging if the mesh isn't riggable. `--animate-in-place` when game code drives locomotion.
- Don't assume the preset name survives into the GLB; inspect the imported clip names before wiring playback.

Source image for `make`: 3/4 elevated angle, solid white/gray background, matte finish, opaque glass, single centered subject — and **do not** rembg it (Tripo needs the solid bg). For characters, generate the reference in a T-pose.

Presets are generic stock clips. **Important:** when gameplay needs a custom humanoid move set (state machines, root-motion locomotion, moves not in this list), read `.claude/skills/asset-gen/motion.md`.

## Costs

Paid generations cost real money, so confirm with the user before generating; `qwen-image` runs are free. Quick reference: 1K image 6–7¢ · 2K background 8–10¢ · a quality-critical image generated on both models ~13¢ · sprite video 14¢/s at 720p. Tripo bills in credits (≈1¢): ~30 per model, ~25 to rig, ~10 per retargeted clip — `tripo balance` before a batch, and report the `credits_consumed` the CLI returns rather than an estimate.

## Output and logging

Each `asset_gen.py` command prints JSON to stdout: `{"ok": true, "path": "...", "cost_cents": 7}`; `tripo` and `qwen-image` print theirs with `--json`. Progress goes to stderr — redirect it to a temp file and read only on failure to keep context clean:

```bash
_log=$(mktemp)
result=$(python3 .claude/skills/asset-gen/tools/asset_gen.py image --prompt "..." -o p.png 2>"$_log") || tail -20 "$_log"
```

Generate independent API images in parallel (multiple Bash calls in one message).

## Visual pitfalls

Generators and vision checks have weak spatial sense — verify from screenshots when it matters.

- **Direction/orientation** is unreliable ("facing left" vs "right" often comes out identical). Generate one direction and flip horizontally at runtime rather than paying for the mirror.
- **Mixed sizes:** image frames are ~1024px, video frames smaller (960px square at 720p). Downscale everything to the smallest source before matting (`magick in.png -resize 960x960 out.png`).
- **Playback fps:** source videos are ~24fps — drive sprite playback off elapsed time at ~1/24s, and only restart a loop when the animation state actually changes.

## Asset manifest (in README.md)

Track every generated asset in `README.md` with an **in-game Size** column — without it, coders consistently scale assets wrong:

- 3D models: meters, e.g. `4m long`, `1.8m tall`, `0.3m`
- Textures: tile size, e.g. `2m tile`
- Backgrounds: pixel size + behavior, e.g. `1920x1080, fullscreen`
- Sprites: display pixels, e.g. `128x128 px`

| Name | Description | Size | Path | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|------|------|
| car | sedan with spoiler | 4m long | assets/glb/car.glb | 7¢ + 30 cr |
